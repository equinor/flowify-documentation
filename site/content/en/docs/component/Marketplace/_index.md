### Component marketplace

Component marketplace allows you to share workspace component to users in other workspaces, increases reusability of your code. For example, a component for getting data from a Blob store only needs to be built once and made available to other projects.

**Marketplace is planned to be implemented**

As a work around, to make a copy of a component, your can copy and paste the manifest in the component editor.
